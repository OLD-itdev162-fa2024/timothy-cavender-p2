Project will include:
- .NetCore background
- EntityFramework with database
- Endpoint to display data in the database
	- I will pre-populate some data


This app will be a mini "cook book". The data stored will be different recipes, which will include the dish name, ingrediants, and cook time. If I can get to making an angular front end, I would like to be able to choose the dish based on a drop down.
