This project is going to emulate a smart fridge. Here the the functions I want to achieve:
Angular Front End
Entity Framework Back End
EF database

--Will Complete
    -Opening Page That chooses Fridge or Recipe Book
    -Fridge will do the following:
        -Display Ingredients in the fridge (Get API)
        -Add/Update Item Quantities in the fridge (Post API)
        -Remove/Update Item Quantities in the fridge (Delete API)

--Optional
    -Recipe Page that will show recipes that can be made, based on the item sin teh fridge
    ***I ran out of time for this page, so it loads some recipes based on a List defaulted
    in the Component page. If I had time, recipes would have been loaded in from the database
